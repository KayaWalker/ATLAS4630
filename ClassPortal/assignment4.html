    <p>Create a webpage that uses the fetch API (a browser API) to send requests any third party API, and display the JSON data that the third party API returns to you on the webpage in a creative fashion.</p>
    <p>You may use this list of APIs to help you decide on an API to use for this assignment, but you are not limited to that list. You may not use the meowfacts API used as an in-class example on September 26th.</p>
